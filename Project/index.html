      <h3>Start</h3>
      <p>
        Samsung was founded in 1938 as a trading company. It was based in Taegu, Korea. Samsung was originally a grocery store.
        Its founder was Lee Byung-chull. It expanded to Seoul but left when the Korean War broke out. 
        Lee branched out and made a sugar refinery, a textile industry, and a woolen mill. When this proved sucessful, Samsung quickly started diversifying.
