        mill. When this proved sucessful, Samsung quickly started diversifying.

      <h3>Predictions</h3>
      <p>
        Samsung will become the single largest provider of bombs to the U.S. military, due to its surplus of Galaxy Note 7s. All jokes aside, Samsung will continue growing and eventually overtake Apple as the #1 smartphone vendor. It will continue to make advancements
        in technology. It will eventually make devices that drastically reduce, if not eliminate, human physical labor. Samsung will eventually have a monopoly on phones, if Apple falls apart.
