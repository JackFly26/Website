    <p>The Ganges River is very important to Indians. It is a daily part of people's lives. People drink and bathe in it. It also provides them with electricity. Sadly, this important river is polluted my many contaminants, including arsenic, a deadly poison.</p>

  <div class="container">
    <p>Some of the main causes of arsenic in the Ganges River are coal combustion, plants and other chemical industries, lead production, waste, fertilizers, and pesticides.</p>

    <p>Arsenic causes lesions on the skin, diffuse melanosis (darkening of skin), and spotted melanosis (white and black spots on their bodies). Those are just the effects on the skin. Cardiovascular effects include ischemic heart disease, blackfoot disease, systemic arteriosclerosis, and gangrene. It also causes cancer. </p>

    <p>To help with the arsenic, people could mark the wells if they are high in arsenic. Water management is also crucial. Installation of new wells should be regulated. Arsenic filtration systems should be implemented. Rainwater harvesting and awareness are big, too.</p>
